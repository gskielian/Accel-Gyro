Speed-Sensor 4 Martial-Arts + More
====

roadmap:
1. getting speed data in 1-d (this is harder than I thought)

2. attaching bluetooth

3. adjusting for the gyroscope

Specs:
------

## Velocity sensing mode

* light to track the velocity mapping red->low speed, violet->high speed
* sends data via bluetooth or something to a computer/Iphone/Android device

## Impact Sensing Modes

Measures the amount of impact

* How many pounds of force in your punch
* the speed of your punch?
* Sends data to the computer/Iphone/Android device

F*delta t = "weight transferred" (in physics speak it's the momentum transferred)

## Bag Sensing Mode

Tells you how heavy your punch is: the momentum transferred

and the max pressure by proxy with the force.


F/m = a/time_window
